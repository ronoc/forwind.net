Forwind (pronounced forwYnd) is a small and independent label based in London.
<br/><br/>
Weâ€™re not interested in music from any particular genre; our catalogue includes free improvisation, electronica, electro-acoustic improv and even songs.
<br/><br/>
Our aim is to provide a platform for music that maximises the expressive potential of sound, instruments and voices either through physical or electronic means, whether composed, constructed or improvised.</p>
