1	CjC	Conor J Curran is an electronic musician and sound artist based\nin London. He studied at Trinity College Dublin under electroacoustic composers\nDonnacha Dennehy and Roger Doyle and has been involved in many different music\nprojects such as Liquid Hifi, Street Thunder, Sonnamble and his solo project CjC.\n  </p><p>His work, both music and audio/visual software, has been used in modern\ndance by Dance Theatre of Ireland (Evidence 2001) and in Film by Conor McCourt\n(Four Cops 1999). Conor's Parallel, a music visualisation application, was\nfeatured at London’s Cybersonica 2002, on Rhizome.org, Neural.it and in 'Exhibit1'at\n the Digital Hub in Dublin from January to March 2003.</p><p>CjC has released material\non Psychonavigation Records, Silverdoor and Forwind. Even though completed in 2003,\nConor's debut solo album 'Form' was not released until 2008 on Forwind. It encompasses\nelectronic instrumentals from melodic to abstract. Spatial geometric concepts act as\nthe origins of the timbre and expression. Form to a large extent was influenced by the\nParallel software Conor was writing at the time. Track titles, album artwork and the\naural visual language all strictly adhere to the spacial concept of Form.	2010-12-12 15:14:12	2011-03-06 21:59:25	cjc.jpg	Dublin, Dungarvan	1999-01-01 00:00:00	2003-01-01 00:00:00

4	Sonnamble	Sonnamble was formed in 2009 by Conor Curran and Peter Marsh to explore the possibilities of live improvisational playing and real time digital processing. Two albums were released featuring Marsh’s stringed instruments (lap steel guitar, double bass and bass guitar) fed through Curran’s custom software routines. These received some critical acclaim and airplay on both the BBC and RTE, drawing comparisons with the likes of Christian Fennesz.	2010-12-12 15:14:12	2012-10-03 09:17:23	sonnamble.jpg	London	2008-01-01 00:00:00	2012-03-06 21:33:36

8	James O'Sullivan	James O’Sullivan is a London-based electric guitar player. His work explores the relationship\nbetween improvisation, recording and performance. He has worked extensively within the parameters of song, in particular in collaboration with song\nwriter David Hurn, and the improvisational quartet Clang Sayne, and his musical input on these\nrecordings is far-ranging. \n</p><p>\nWith David Hurn’s material, his contribution is always attached to and\ncentred around a pre-existing song, and serves to continue the idea or mood created by the voice,\nwords or chord changes within the song itself. With Clang Sayne, although the first record consists\nof improvisations around a set of pre-written songs, the outcomes are more unpredictable, the main\naim being to create songs or pieces of music in the moment of playing, through establishing a solid\nrapport within the group of musicians.\n</p><p>\nIn addition to these ongoing projects, O’Sullivan and Hurn are the founders of ‘Four Seasons\nTelevision’, a project that, using the two founders’ improvisations as a sort of centre, collaborates\nwith musicians of wide-ranging influences. James is also a member of the improvisational group\nfounded by Thanos Chrysakis, ‘Tetras’.	2010-12-12 15:14:12	2012-03-21 22:53:36	jos.jpg	London	2005-01-01 00:00:00	2012-03-06 21:33:36

312708593	Elvers	'Elvers' is a trio formed in 2008 by friends who wished to\n explore a shared interest in improvised music making without rules, particularly\n improv rules. Its members have been playing together in various combinations for\nmuch longer though. Trumpet player Ian R. Watson, double bassist Peter Marsh and\npercussionist Paul May have been regular or semi regular fixtures on the fringes\nof the London free improv scene over the last few years. </p><p>Watson and Marsh took\npart in many of Ashley Wales's short run club night 'Back in your town' at the Red\nRose until its demise. But most of their playing is in different areas such as\nfolk, jazz, rock and blues - May with Duke Garwood, Petra Jean Philliipson,\n Carolyn Hume, Clang Sayne and others (often in tandem with Marsh),\n whilst  Watson currently plays with Solus Rex, 64 bit and The Treecreepers,\na duo with Bellowhead percussionist Pete Flood. Marsh and Watson also collaborated\n in electric jazz outfit Lob.	2011-03-06 21:33:36	2012-03-21 22:54:25	elvers.jpg	London	2008-01-01 00:00:00	2012-03-06 21:33:36
312708594	Clang Sayne	Clang Sayne is a platform for songwriter and improvisor, Laura Hyland\nto collaborate with other artists from all disciplines. It began as a\nband exploring the boundaries between song and improvisation, the main\noutput of which to date has been the album, 'Winterlands', and ongoing\nmusical performances. Since its incarnation Clang Sayne has slowly\nbegun to grow into a bigger project combining song and improvisation\nwith other artforms.	2011-03-17 00:14:31	2011-03-21 09:57:03	clangsayne.jpg	London, Wexford	2008-01-01 00:00:00	2011-03-17 00:14:31
312708595	fourth page	4th Page's music is improvised. Some of it sounds like it wasn't. Fragments of jazz, trace elements of the more experimental side of English folk and even Krautrock surface in a quietly intense music that floats effortlessly between dark, stretched songforms and impressionist abstraction.<br/><br/>\nHeralding mainly from London, Fourth Page came together informally in 2010. The members had played together in\nvarious combinations but not as a quartet. <br/><br/>Carolyn Hume and Paul May had played as a duo for the last ten years\nreleasing five critically acclaimed albums on Leo Records, Peter Marsh and Paul May have played together in\nvarious groups as well as recently providing the live rhythm section for Petra Jean Phillipson. Charlie Beresford\n(known in the main for his solo work and studio production) came into the equation after a recent recording that he,\nPaul May and Duke Garwood made under the guise of Abdon Liberty.	2011-05-18 23:45:19	2012-03-21 22:55:40	fourth_page.jpg	London	2010-01-01 00:00:00	2012-05-18 23:45:19

312708600	Dentistry	Dublin trio, Dentistry, consisting of Cian Walker,\n Patrick Fennelly and Jason Joomun, draw influence from a large number of\n sources from Cage to Ambarchi. </br> Starting off as a virtual collaboration the project developed online and         \norganically until they were ready to enter the studio armed with instruments\nand electronics to record the material for their debut.  Vardøgr is \nthe end product of those sessions where the trio set about producing a work\nthat hinged on extensive improvisation as well as more traditional \nstructure.	2012-03-21 20:19:17	2012-04-09 11:01:17	dentistry.jpg	Dublin	20011-01-01 00:00:00	2012-03-21 20:19:17
312708601	Tomonari Nozaki	Tomonari Nozaki is an emerging producer from Tokyo.\nHe originally operated in the minimal techno scene in Japan where his focus was very much on the abstract. \nHe experimented further which led to his sound evolving into the more lush and compositional widescreen analogue soundscapes he now creates. Devastating and emotive are two words that come to mind.\n<br/><br/>\nTomo's technique uses a mix of reel to reel tape edits, analogue synths and a whole host of old outboard. After listening it is obvious that Tomos current work wasn't produced on a computer. A perceptive ear as always with Forwind material is mandatory.\n<br/><br/>\nHe has been previously released under his <i>UNKNOWNjp</i> alias on the Slovakian Label Soun Records. The next installment in his fast maturing sound will be heard when he makes his physical release debut on forwind in early 2013.<br/><br/>Photo by Ryu Kasai.	2012-11-28 18:42:26	2012-12-13 12:33:29	tomo.jpg	Tokyo	1998-11-28 18:40:53	2012-11-28 18:41:41

3	New Logo	![Forwind Logo](http://www.forwind.net/images/index/forwind_logo.gif)\r\n\r\nTrying to conjure a brief for a new logo design for Forwind was for us a daunting task. \r\nUp until now design for either of the two releases or the site has been the good work of Paul Finn. \r\n\r\nWe definitely wanted to keep this style but just add a touch of graphic finesse to the overall look through the logo. \r\n\r\n\r\nI think the overall brief for Hannes (designer) amounted to "we would like to\r\nrepresent the idea of winding, to stress that the pronunciation is\r\nforw/y/nd not forw/i/nd." Not much direction given there really, doesn't elaborate much on what it should be instead focuses on something else entirely.\r\nEither way Hannes obviously knew exactly what to do and for that Shane and I would like to thank you so much ! It suits the subtle clean design previously laid down by Paul while also marking out its own take on what Forwind is about. \r\n\r\nGreat work Hannes, much appreciated.  \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n	2010-12-21 19:33:24	2010-12-21 20:52:34	t	2	2010-12-21 20:45:54

And even more so when you are not exactly releasing music that is going to trouble  the charts.... if they still exist!\r\n\r\nAs a result of the above we can now finally announce release dates for our next three albums:\r\n\r\nJames O'Sullivan's 'feed back couple', Elvers - 'Elvers' and Clang Sayne - 'Winterlands' will all be released on May16th and available to buy through boomkat , itunes, amazon etc.\r\n\r\nWill update soon with further details about the releases including availability of physical formats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n	2011-05-02 09:30:59	2011-05-02 13:48:12	t	1	2011-05-02 13:48:12
17	New releases - Elvers	[![Elvers album art work](http://www.forwind.net/images/releases/fwd03.png)](http://www.forwind.net/releases/FWD03)\r\n\r\nWriting about music is, as someone famously said, a bit like dancing to architecture. It's even harder when you're responsible for the music, or at least a third of it. Anyway, here goes...\r\n\r\nElvers are a trio of Ian R. Watson, trumpet, Peter Marsh (ie me), bass and Paul May on drums. We've been together a couple of years though have played together in various combinations for quite a lot longer. We recorded and mixed the album in a day at Onecat studios in Brixton, then collected our favourite bits together for Conor to work his mastering magic on the results.\r\n\r\nThe tricky bit is describing what we do - everything is improvised and I suppose there are bits of jazz in there as well as drones, weird clanging and squeaking and the occasional groove. What I do like about this group is the space in it, and the warmth. Some of it's very pretty, some of it's quite confrontational. Some of it sounds like pygmy music made on a distant moon. And it's less than 40 minutes long. Just like a proper album. We hope you like it.	2011-05-19 23:32:14	2011-05-20 09:08:48	t	3	2011-05-19 23:32:14
18	New release - James O' Sullivan - Feedback Couple	[![feed back couple artwork](http://forwind.net/images/releases/fwd02.png)](http://www.forwind.net/releases/FWD02)\r\n\r\nI'm not on this record, which makes it easier to write about. I do play with James in a couple of groups, and have seen him play in various line-ups and most rewardingly, solo. And I can say in all honesty that he's one of the most remarkable guitarists I've ever played with or seen anywhere come to think of it.\r\n\r\nHere he's on his own, with his Telecaster, trusty but knackered Yamaha amp and an array of metal objects, drumsticks and various unidentified bits and pieces. And that's it. No loopers, phasers, flangers, pitchshifters or fuzzboxes. (He does use a volume pedal, but that doesn't really count). I should add that James can also play a bit like Chet Atkins, but he hasn't done that here.\r\n\r\nWhat he has done is craft a series of improvised guitar pieces that range from the starkly beautiful to the scabrously filthy. And it's up there with pretty much any improvised guitar music I can think of. Not only is O'Sullivan's vocabulary of textures pretty huge, he uses them with an attention to structure and development that is pretty rigorous, Which makes it a rewarding listen, even though you most likely wouldn't want to listen to it first thing in the morning. \r\n\r\nIf I was reviewing this album for a clever musical publication I'd probably end up describing the title track as sounding like the sound of an electricity substation being slowly demolished by robots in a rainstorm. Which isn't very helpful, I suppose. Even if it is quite accurate. \r\n\r\nDid you get that I like it? Seriously, if you're into exploratory guitar music, this one's for you. Honest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n	2011-05-20 00:15:01	2011-05-20 09:07:18	t	3	2011-05-20 00:15:01

20	NEW RELEASE - CLANG SAYNE - WINTERLANDS	[![Clang Sayne Winterlands artwork](http://forwind.net/images/releases/fwd04.png)](http://forwind.net/releases/FWD04)\r\n\r\nI played the bass on this one but I'm going to write about it as if I hadn't, because that's a lot easier. Plus, it's not like I wrote any of it. Which isn't a disclaimer, by the way. See? It's not easy writing about stuff you've played on. Particularly when the rest of the band might read it. \r\n\r\n\r\nSo (adopts neutral tone)... This album has already created a wee bit of a stir, picking up some very favourable reviews and airplay since its initial CD release in 2010. \r\n\r\n\r\nThough the name Clang Sayne applies to any number of collaborative projects involving singer and guitarist Laura Hyland, Winterlands was recorded by a quartet that had worked pretty intensively together. \r\n\r\n\r\nClang Sayne's music has often been termed 'avant folk', but it's not really on the money as a description. Someone once described it as 'AMM meets Joni Mitchell', which Laura hated, but at least iit's more specific. \r\n\r\n\r\nHer songs are deceptively complex, their melodies picked out by her nimbly intricate acoustic guitar and lithe, expressive singing. Meanwhile bass, drums and guitar create a restless, swooping backdrop of drones, soft, clicking pulses and nautical clanging (6th form poetry alert), some of which is more or less scored, some entirely improvised. \r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a distinctly nautical feel to the whole album (see 'Brigantine' and 'Shipwrecks' for the most obvious examples), but it's not all drift; a couple of tunes threaten to rock out and James O' Sullivan's electric guitar often gets feral and nasty. \r\n\r\n\r\nSome songs are barely songs at all in the usual sense or are put together, while others flirt with more conventional forms.  Comparisons have been made to people like Tim Buckley, late Talk Talk and Sandy Denny, but they're really not on the money either.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Abandons neutral tone) listening now after a long while and so having a bit of distance from it, it does feel like we got something quite special for about 70% of the record. Which isn't a bad hit rate. And that the songs we were working with were all pretty special. \r\n\r\n\r\nAnyway enough of my yakkin', as Marty Di Bergi would say.

22	New Release - Fourth Page - Along The Weak Rope	![Along the weak rope, fourth page art work](http://forwind.net/images/releases/fwd05.png)\r\n\r\nSimilar to Pete I guess I felt a bit strange when asked to write a few words about Fourth Page – while I wasn’t involved in making the album I have been part of the team of beavers at the label trying to get it across the finish line release wise - and these things should be neutral right?! Well yes, but to be fair I had so little to do with anything involving the erm/haha A&R bit of this album ending up on forwind I do feel there is suitable distance between me and the release to not be indicted just yet...\r\n\r\nSo the album. Well the first thing I thought when sitting down to write about it was how I was going to avoid saying 'dark and moody'. But I can't. Those words were made for this album and it's just not fair if I can't use them here! So there - we are done with it! But review cliches aside the album is without doubt at times a very intense listen. The foreboding title track itself being a perfect example of this. There is a real feeling of menace and danger with the minor piano chords, scattering percussion and Beresford's murky, evocative image of moving 'along the weak rope'. But there is also a real sense of adventure and mischief in there too especially in the vocal that encourages the listener to 'lean across the edge'. There are certain animation studios around the planet I would love to see have a go at providing an accompanying video. But in the context of the album it's a very effective opener that really pulls you in from the get go and grabs your attention before some of the more downbeat reflective tracks that follow.\r\n\r\nTracks like 'Your Warm Silhouette' and 'The Air in Between' are definitely at the slower paced end of the scale on the album but they are still too brooding, mournful and indeed busy to ever feel 'laid back'. This sense of contrast between the introspective feel of the album and the outside danger and chaos is perfectly linked up and aurally represented in what Paul May brings to the tracks with his arsenal of ruzzers, rickles, vwipps and twizzers! (You'll understand when you listen!) They ping their way around the mix in some of the more minimal moments arrangement wise and really add an eccentric, edgy but complementary rhythmical edge to the proceedings, and also gives the songs some extra bite and depth during some of the more traditional sounding arrangements.\r\n\r\nThe production is excellent throughout and manages to pull off that trick of making the whole experience seem quite intimate – you can hear Beresford's every hiss - while giving the fantastic musicianship plenty of room to breathe and be appreciated. And it genuinely deserves this. Hume's piano performances are engaging throughout and effectively restrained especially in places like the beginning of 'The Air in Between'. Marsh adds a warm and industrious backbone to the tracks where he is a little further down in the mix and puts in as near as there is to a rollicking performance on the tracks he completely drives like 'Citadel'.\r\n\r\nSo there's my snapshot.  If you are looking for something to fill that moody, jazzy, reflective, melancholy etc etc late night slot on your playlist but like me need it to still have some real aftertaste then this is a highly recommended addition..	2011-06-18 20:50:28	2011-06-19 13:19:19	t	1	2011-06-19 13:17:57

25	New Release - Sonnamble - Blindlight	[![Sonnamble Blindlight FWD06](http://forwind.net/images/releases/fwd06.png)](http://www.forwind.net/releases/fwd06)\r\n\r\n[Blindlight](http://www.forwind.net/releases/fwd06) is the second release from London based electro-acoustic\r\nimprovisers Sonnamble, again consisting of Conor Curran on electronics\r\nand software and Peter Marsh on stringed instruments. \r\n\r\nThe recording sessions took place not long after the release of the duo's well received debut Seven Months in E Minor and according to Curran it's 'a nice little closer to that chapter'. Again, the focus is on Marsh's lap steel guitar, whose drones, chords and twangs are coaxed into expansive ambient\r\nfuzziness or atomised into grains of noise by Curran's home-cooked\r\nsoftware. But there's a spareness and a more pronounced spikiness to the music this time round; it's still immersive stuff, but more edgy. There's even some spoken word on the closing Society;\r\na recording of Curran's uncle describing the state of Irish mental health in the last century. It's funnier than it sounds, but the combination with the dolorous swirls of processed lap steel give it a curious emotional resonance.\r\nThe title is a corruption of the name of an installation piece by sculptor\r\nAntony Gormley, in which vistors were invited to wander around in a\r\nlarge, brightly lit glass tank full of thick grey fog. "I went two or three\r\ntimes", says Marsh. "It was a very weird, but kind of comforting experi-\r\nence. You could hardly see your hand in front of your face. The music,\r\nwhen it's really working, gives me the same kind of feeling, so it seemed\r\nlike a good title for what we'd done..."\r\nOpening track ‘Aphelion I’ was selected for the latest Wire Tapper\r\ncompilation available with the August edition of the magazine.\r\n	2011-07-25 12:38:24	2011-07-25 12:43:00	t	2	2011-07-25 12:43:00
26	RE-RELEASE-CJC-FORM	[![CjC-Form-Artwork](http://forwind.net/images/releases/fwd00.png)](http://www.forwind.net/releases/FWD00)\r\n\r\nIt may seem a little odd 'rereleasing' this album. [Form](http://www.forwind.net/releases/FWD00) is about 8 years old, has had numerous tracks from it put out on vinyl and various compilations and had a full long player printed as the first Forwind release back in 2008. \r\n<br/>\r\nBack in 2008 when I went about compiling the album, I took all my finished pieces from the said period and tried to find a track order and listing. Many tracks did not make the cut. Others were shortened with various little edits and then mastered with what tools I had to hand (at the time using Studio 64 linux distro running just Jamin!). Not having the appropriate hardware or monitoring for mastering can be problematic particularly when the source material is a sampled and sequenced digital work. For this edition I have changed the version of Elastic (previously released on vinyl on [Psychonavigation](http://psychonavigation.com) - PSY 002) from what was included in the 2008 edition. The reason being that during the recent mastering of Form at Cyclone it became apparent that the previously released mix was essentially distorted !\r\n<br/>\r\nIt seems that in my attempt to master Form on my own in 2008 I had obviously overlooked some glaring problems.\r\nLesson learnt, never master your own output. A mastering engineer will immediately hear glaring issues that you won't. \r\n<br/>\r\nThis kind of audio in my opinion really needs warming up during the mastering which can be difficult to achieve without some nice and expensive analogue kit, something like this [Manley](http://www.manley.com/mslc.php) for instance. Graham at [Cyclone](http://www.cyclonemusic.co.uk/index.html) did a fantastic job here. The lower mids as usual were problematic but also I had over EQ'd the life out of it in the 2008 version. Graham managed to restore life to it and also give it a well needed polish.\r\n<br/>\r\nForm is an album that was written between 2001-03 while I lived in Dublin and in my home town of Dungarvan. For majority of that time I was studying at the Music & Media technologies department at Trinity college Dublin where I was fortunate to be lectured by the likes of [Donnacha Dennehey](http://www.donnachadennehy.com/), Dermot Furlong and [Roger Doyle](http://rogerdoyle.com/). I would like to think the course material (such as electroacoustic composition and survey, Psychoacoustics, DSP) deeply influenced my output during this period. All instruments were originally sourced. Either recorded live or created from scratch from sampling or DSP. It features vocalists such as Laura Hyland from Clang Sayne and Suzanne Spratt whose previous choir experience adds a definite haunted feeling to track 4, In Between.\r\n<br/>  \r\nThis remastered version finally has the feel to it that I was trying to achieve way back when. The artwork delivered by [Paul Finn](http://www.fitzroyandfinn.co.uk) back in 2008 perfectly captured the aesthetic that we were after. At last, 8 years later, I can now sleep soundly knowing Form is actually finished. Anal, I know I know ...	2011-08-15 23:01:14	2011-08-16 00:03:41	t	2	2011-08-16 00:03:40

Forwindings is an event that brings many of\r\nthem together in the suitably atmospheric setting of London’s\r\nShoreditch Church in an evening of eclectic, and immersive sonic\r\nexploration.\r\n<br/>\r\nEclectic is the word; the music on offer ranges from sludgecore dub to\r\nfree improv to dystopic ambient drones to improvised songs to ambient\r\njazz and live electroacoustic processing and a few dozen other hybrids\r\nthat might not exist just yet.

Listen to a sneak preview [here](http://soundcloud.com/forwind/sonnamble-live-in-london). \r\n\r\nAnother new addition are Dublin trio Dentistry, who describe themselves as having influences from Cage to Ambarchi; their album is an eclectic mix of improv and structure from electronics and live instrumentation, and is much more fun that that description might suggest...\r\n\r\nAlso there'll be a live recording from Fourth Page made at Forwindings last year which the band reckon is their best yet. Another sneak preview is [here](http://soundcloud.com/forwind/fourth-page-ticks-and-moans).\r\n\r\nWe're also working on another Forwindings event to be held at Shoreditch Church at around the same time; again, date to be announced...	2012-01-24 17:05:02	2012-03-19 19:58:05	t	3	2012-01-24 17:05:02

67	LAC 2012	![CCRMA's listening room](http://www.forwind.net/images/index/listening_room.jpg)\r\nOver the weekend I attended the Linux Audio Conference at Stanford, California. Sonnamble's Aphelion (I & II) was fortunate to be included in the listening roster at the CCRMA's listening room (pictured above).  \r\n<br/>\r\nNeedless to say the whole conference was inspiring. An event like this in such a location attracts a very interesting assortment of heads from musicians to engineers to inventors or more likely a mixture of all of the above. I would like to thank the organisers [Fernando Lopez-Lezcano](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~nando/) and [Bruno Ruviaro](http://www.brunoruviaro.com/), Frank Neumann, [Robin Gareus](http://gareus.org/) and [Julius O.

70	Dentistry - 'Vardøgr' Out Today	[![alt text](http://www.forwind.net/images/releases/fwd07.png)](http://www.forwind.net/releases/fwd07)\r\n\r\nForwind 07 hits the virtual shelves today at [boomkat](http://boomkat.com/downloads/518446-dentistry-vard-gr), iTunes, [Amazon](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Vard%C3%B8gr/dp/B007UD4XX0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1337539975&sr=8-1), [Juno](http://www.junodownload.com/products/vardogr/1958109-02/) and all the usual suspects.\r\n\r\nHere are the details! \r\n<br/> \r\n\r\nForwind is very pleased to present one of the murkiest, most foreboding excursions on the label so far in [‘Vardøgr’](http://www.forwind.net/releases/FWD07) the debut long player from the Dublin trio [Dentistry](http://www.forwind.net/artists/Dentistry).\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\nThe word vardøgr is a Norwegian term defined as 'a premonitory sound or sight of a person before he arrives’. Like a reverse episode of déjà vu possibly, the title hints at many of the mysterious sensory anomalies that have confronted many of the great thinkers and spiritualists as they have contemplated the philosophical minefield of trying to understand human consciousness and perception. And it is this foggy terrain that gets explored over the albums five tracks.\r\n<br/>\r\nDentistry are Cian Walker, Patrick Fennelly and Jason Joomun -\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\nStarting off as a virtual collaboration the project developed offline and organically until they were ready to enter the studio armed with instruments and electronics to record the material for their debut. Vardøgr is the end product of those sessions where the trio set about producing a work that hinged on extensive improvisation as well as more traditional stucture. They draw influence from a large number of sources from Cage to Ambarchi which is evidenced in the restrained and evocative nature of their beguiling debut. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\nHope you get a chance to listen.	2012-05-20 18:56:27	2012-05-21 08:57:49	t	1	2012-05-21 00:41:58

74	Fourth Page - Ticks and Moans Out Now!	![](http://forwind.net/images/releases/fwd08.png)\r\n\r\nThe new Fourth Page album (FWD08) is out today. Here's the press release...\r\n\r\nThis is the third release from Fourth Page and their second for Forwind. It's a live set recorded at St Leonard's Church in Shoreditch during the Forwindings mini-festival in late 2011 (previous releases were also recorded live, but without an audience).\r\n\r\nThis is possibly the group's most brooding and atmospheric work to date, sumptuously recorded in St Leonard's spacious acoustic by guitarist/vocalist Charlie Beresford. Joining him as usual are pianist Carolyn Hume, bassist Peter Marsh and percussionist Paul May for a suite of five spontaneously composed songs. \r\n\r\nReviews of the band's previous recordings have drawn comparisons with Mark Hollis, Robert Wyatt, classic Krautrock, the Spontaneous Music Ensemble and even Schubert's Winterreise. There's probably a lot of truth in those comparisons, but it's the band's ability to take elements of jazz, minimalism and free improvisation and stitch them into stretched, hushed, dark songs before your ears that's the most remarkable thing about them. Clocking in at 37 minutes, this is a record where barely a note is wasted. We hope you like it.\r\n\r\nThe band are on tour at the moment You can listen to two pieces recorded a few days back [here](http://soundcloud.com/4thpage/sets/live-recordings-summer-2012/).	2012-08-06 13:08:38	2012-08-06 21:43:13	t	3	2012-08-06 13:09:09

81	Tomonari Nozaki 'North Palace' Out Now	[![north palace cover](http://forwind.net/images/releases/fwd09.png)](http://www.forwind.net/releases/fwd09)\r\n\r\nEveryone at forwind is delighted to finally let go of the balloon and unleash Tokyo based producer ‘Tomonari Nozaki’s [‘North Palace’](http://www.forwind.net/releases/fwd09)\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nHe may not be the only artist to have forsaken the convenience of producing his music on a macbook but there haven't been many we have heard who have produced such a thoroughly captivating sound from their old reel to reel tape units and analogue equipment in recent times.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n‘Tomo's' hugely immersive sound feels like opening an old dusty wooden box and hearing a frayed melancholy soundtrack to somewhere standing outside of time and the concerns of the world. It manages to be remote and indefinable in parts but has such spirit and warmth it's hard not to let yourself become completely absorbed.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nTomonari has been previously released under his UNKNOWNjp. alias on the Slovakian Label Soun Records. ‘North Palace’ sees him make his physical release debut, the first of hopefully many more.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n It has been a real labour of love getting this album across the finish line with a huge amount of TLC going into the production, mastering, artwork and presentation.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n \r\nThere is an album sampler available to listen to now on [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/forwind/fwd09-tomonari-nozaki-north) featuring excerpts from all of the albums tracks\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n \r\nWe hope you enjoy the music as much as we enjoyed helping to get it out there.\r\n \r\n	2013-02-24 18:04:07	2013-02-28 12:34:24	t	1	2013-02-28 12:34:24

83	Live Sonnamble Podcast	[![Frozen Leaves](http://forwind.net/images/podcasts/FWDP13.jpg)](http://forwind.net/podcasts/13)\r\n</br>\r\nOur first [podcast](http://forwind.net/podcasts/13) of 2013 is now available. It is a collection of live performances from the *Sonnamble* four piece that played Vienna a number of times, Budapest and London during the last quarter of 2011 and mid 2012. </br></br>\r\nUnfortunately this will be the last of that line-up for *Sonnamble*. In truth this podcast is the failed attempt at a third album. [Blindlight](http://forwind.net/releases/fwd06) (*Sonnamble's* second) was  recorded way back in 2010 and ever since we had been struggling to move the project on to a new phase experimenting with different line-ups but never really gaining any momentum or consistency. I may continue with *Sonnamble* again at some point but for now the project is retired.\r\n</br></br>\r\nThis line-up for these performances is:\r\n</br></br>\r\nWei-ya Lin - Viola<br/>\r\nPaul May - Percussion<br/>\r\nPeter Marsh - Double Bass/Dobro guitar<br/>\r\nConor Curran - Electronics<br/>\r\n</br>\r\nAs ever mixed, mastered and produced by Conor Curran.\r\n</br></br>\r\nPhotography by mother dearest Maura Curran at Glenlodge, Dungarvan, Ireland.\r\n</br></br>\r\nAvailable to stream @ [Mixcloud](http://www.mixcloud.com/Forwind/sonnamblings/)\r\n  	2013-04-11 14:36:19	2013-04-12 23:19:07	t	2	2013-04-11 15:09:47

2	Seven months in E minor	<i>Seven Months In E Minor is a record which unveils its profound beauty with great care, and requires a level on commitment to fully appreciate its depth. This said, the great ease with which Sonnamble arrange the various components at their disposal into consistent pieces and the deep level of understanding between the two musicians makes it a wonderfully enjoyable record.</i> - themilkfactory	2010-03-29 00:00:00	<i>Seven Months In E Minor is a record which unveils its profound beauty with great care, and requires a level on commitment to fully appreciate its depth.</i> - themilkfactory	FWD01	4	t
5	feed back couple	‘feed back\ncouple’ consists of pieces taken from long, exploratory recordings, which show the range of James's solo\nwork at that point in time, from textural, abstract (almost ambient) use of the guitar to more free-\nflowing, percussive, angular and (even!) melodic. The over-arching aim in all cases is to show the\ndetail and potential of each sound or sound event.	2011-05-16 10:00:00	<i>O'Sullivan manages to produce rich and varied music ... He is adept at generating several complementary sounds simultaneously, often creating the impression that there is more than one player at work.</i> - John Eyles - all about jazz	FWD02	8	t
6	elvers	<i>Each of the three has his own distinctive style, but readily adapts to the playing of the other two—true to that desire not to make rules. So, when Marsh's bass gets into a groove and lays down a repeated bass line well into the lengthy 'Sawtooth' (each track is titled after a type of eel, in keeping with the group's name), May and then Watson fall in with it as naturally as breathing. And when Marsh ceases to play the line, they revert to equal three-way playing as before. Simple: no rules, no dogma...</i> - John Eyles, All about Jazz	2011-05-16 11:00:00	<i>Overall, the album reveals Elvers to have its own well-defined identity and sound, a happy amalgam of its three component parts, making it a group to watch.</i> - John Eyles, all about jazz	FWD03	312708593	t
7	Winterlands	<i>This is a set of live, organic, no-safety-net performances; there is something exhilarating about this modest yet perverse album and its refusal to conform</i> - Clive Bell, The Wire	2011-05-16 12:00:00	<i>This is a set of live, organic, no-safety-net performances; there is something exhilarating about this modest yet perverse album and its refusal to conform</i> - Clive Bell, The Wire.	FWD04	312708594	t
8	Along the weak rope	“...beautifully produced doing justice to all the amazing sounds, and I love the Hawksmoor, damp, cobwebby feel . I thought it was perhaps the sort of song cycle Schubert might have written if he'd been around today. The anguish of Winterreise with its chinks of light.... Sylvian too.” - Fiona Talkington, Late Junction, BBC Radio 3	2011-05-31 00:00:00	<i>I thought it was perhaps the sort of song cycle Schubert might have written if he'd been around today. The anguish of Winterreise with its chinks of light.... Sylvian too.</i> - Fiona Talkington, Late Junction, BBC Radio 3.	FWD05	312708595	t
9	Blindlight	Blindlight is the second release from London based electro-acoustic improvisers Sonnamble, again consisting of Conor Curran on electronics and software and Peter Marsh on stringed instruments.<br/><br/> Again the focus is on Marsh's lap steel guitar, whose drones, chords and twangs are coaxed into expansive ambient fuzziness or atomised into grains of noise by Curran's home-cooked software patches. But there's a spareness and a more pronounced spikiness to the music this time round; it's still immersive uff, but more edgy... <br/><br/> This record was initially released in mid 2011, a remixed/remastered version of this album was re-released both physically (digipak CD) and digitally in October 2012.	2012-10-15 12:56:09	<i> Sonnamble’s approach is an intellectual one, with melody and rhythm alien concepts. Yet these ambient, floating, minimalist soundscapes still have the ability to emote...</i> - Wyndham Wallace - BBC Music	FWD06	4	t
10	VARDØGR	One of the murkiest, most foreboding excursions on the label so far - <i>Vardøgr</i> is the debut long player from the Dublin trio Dentistry. </br> The word vardøgr is a Norwegian term defined as <i>a premonitory sound or sight of a person before he arrives...</i>	2012-05-21 00:00:00	<i>This trio has done well to exercise restraint, to suggest rather than to show.  In using this technique, they imitate the best directors, who create tension without resorting to shock...</i> - Richard Allen - A Closer Listen	FWD07	312708600	t
11	Ticks and Moans	Ticks and Moans is the third release from Fourth Page and their second for Forwind. As usual, the music is entirely improvised and performed live, though this time it was recorded in front of an audience in the beautiful acoustic of St Leonard's Church, Shoreditch. A sumptuously recorded, darkly atmospheric mix of improvised song and texture that is their best work so far.	2012-08-06 00:00:00	Recorded in front of an audience in the beautiful acoustic of St Leonard's Church, Shoreditch. Our second Fourth Page release is a darkly atmospheric mix of improvised song and texture that is their best work so far.	FWD08	312708595	t
12	North Palace	'North Palace' is the third release and first physical by Tokyo composer and producer Tomonari Nozaki. \n<br/><br/>\n'Tomo's' hugely immersive sound feels like opening an old dusty wooden box and \nhearing a frayed melancholy soundtrack to somewhere standing outside of time and the concerns of the world.\nIt manages to be remote and indefinable in parts but has such spirit, sincerity and indeed warmth it's hard not \nto let yourself become completely absorbed.<br/><br/> \nAnyone who has been following the forwind story so far will know we don't go for bluster.\nHand on heart this is genuinely sublime stuff.	2013-02-25 00:00:00	Our most distant neighbour to join us on the label so far, Tomonari comes good from Tokyo with an unabashed and resplendent set of tracks that are easily some of the most emotive and affecting heard on forwind so far.
