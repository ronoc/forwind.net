            <p>Forwind (pronounced forwYnd) is a multi-genre label currently operating from Berlin, Manchester and London.</p>
            <p>We&#39;rre not worried about fitting neatly into one section in the record shop. Our passion is for adventurous music with a serious attention to detail, from the performance to the production.</p>
            <p>Our aim is to provide a platform for music that maximises the expressive potential of sound, instruments and voices either through physical or electronic means, whether composed, constructed or improvised.</p>
